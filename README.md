# GoToClass
A smart reminder and note-taking application for students compatible with iOS devices built with Swift 3.


Usability:
- Students log their # of courses as well as university schedule. 
- The application will make folders for each course locally in the application not accessible outside. In return,
- Students get notified/reminded to attend a class 30 minutes before it starts.
- The application checks if the user is not in the university, if so then get current location of user, if no more than 30 minutes away from university then ignore it. A standard reminder about 30 minutes before class appears.
- If student is further away than 30 minutes from school, a notification will appear to remind student about the upcoming class along with estimated travel time that is if the user left place at the moment of receiving the notification to ensure no class is missed.
- Once a student makes it to classroom and opens the application, it knows which day and class the student is in and it opens to the right folder.
- Students are now able to take photos of notes/boards/slides/etc and they will be saved locally to that folder inside the application.
